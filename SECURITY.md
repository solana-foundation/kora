## Reporting Security Problems

**DO NOT CREATE A GITHUB ISSUE** to report a security problem.

Instead please use this [Report a Vulnerability](https://github.com/solana-foundation/kora/security/advisories/new) link.

Provide a helpful title and detailed description of the problem.

Expect a response as fast as possible in the advisory, typically within 72 hours.
